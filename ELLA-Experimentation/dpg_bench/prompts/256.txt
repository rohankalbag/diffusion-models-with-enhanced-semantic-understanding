A metal ladder, silver and slightly weathered, stands against a partially-built brick wall within a construction site. Nearby, a sturdy shovel with a wooden handle and a dirt-stained blade leans against a mound of earth. Small clumps of soil spill onto the ground beside it. In the background, the silhouette of an unfinished building looms against the night sky, its shape barely visible under the faint glow of a distant street lamp.
